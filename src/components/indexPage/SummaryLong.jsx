      I know, it&#39;s wild, I&#39;m almost under fourty! Actually I was born,
      on the day, exactly 100 years after Albert Einstein. My daughter,
      Eli-Marie was born, on the day, 36 years after me. The date is March 14,
      which is, observed correctly, the beginning of PI 3,14. Eli&#39;s birthday
      in 2015 is even closer: 3.1415 &mdash; it&#29;s almost spooky!

          Moose and Hippos are also pretty awesome animals, but not enough to
          make it to the top three. Cats are waaay waay down on the list,
          propably all the way down to place 100 or beyond. Because they like to
          torture and kill little birds. Luckily birds have the Crows, who
          sometimes tease and annoy the crap out of cats.
